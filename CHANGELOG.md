## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

First version.

### Added

- **`layoutBracket`**: the rounds, halves, rows, byes and results of a knockout, worked out from its ties (who plays whom, or `feeds`), for ties that are one game (with extra time and a shoot-out), a best-of-N series, two or more legs added up, or a drawn game replayed. Two halves that meet at the final, named for the groups when they split cleanly, or one tree left to right; a third-place match placed apart; ties that lead nowhere kept in `other`.
- **`drawBracket`**: the bracket as one SVG string, wide (1200 by 675), square (1080 by 1080) or phone (390 wide, the rounds as rows), with full, compact or mark-only boxes, round or square team marks from a logo address or inline SVG (each written once as a `<symbol>`), the champion in the centre with a trophy slot, light, dark and a gold-on-navy poster look, every colour a `--tb-*` custom property, `role="img"` with a title and description, and ids from a hash of the input.
- **`bracketTable`** and **`describeBracket`**: the same bracket as an HTML table and as a sentence.
- **`singleElimination`**, **`advanceWinners`**, **`standardSeeds`** and **`matchupsFromGames`**: brackets for any number of teams, seeded in the standard way with byes, results carried forward, and matchups from a flat list of games.
- **`playoffFormat`** and **`playoffEras`**: round names, series lengths, byes and teams by era for the NHL, NBA, MLB, NFL, CFL and the FIFA World Cup.
- Entry points `/layout` and `/presets`; no dependencies.
- A demo with the NHL 2024 playoffs, the World Cup of 2022 and 1938, MLB 2022 (byes), two-legged ties, a 32-team field and a flags-only poster, in a playground that changes the size, look and shape.
