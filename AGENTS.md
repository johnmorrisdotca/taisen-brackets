This repo is one of the family of John Morris's npm packages. The rules every package repo shares are below; what differs is in the **Facts** table under the marker.

## Read first

1. spx-stats `docs/package-work.md` (https://github.com/spxis/spx-stats/blob/main/docs/package-work.md), and the section "Who may change what" in spx-stats `AGENTS.md`. They hold the boards, filing, checks, release, hand-off and reporting rules. If your session has an spx-stats checkout, `git pull` it first.
2. This repo's `CONTRIBUTING.md` and README, for the rules and commands of the code itself.
3. The Facts table below: your board, ports, checks, release path and hand-off project.

## Work

- **Board.** Every ticket for this repo is on the board named in Facts, titled `<title prefix>: ...` with `--area <title prefix>`. From the spx-stats checkout's `web/` directory: `pnpm task --board <board> list`, then `claim <id> "<who>"` with the whole id before you start. Read the ticket's full detail first. Anything you find outside your ticket becomes a new ticket; say so in your report. Never run `done`: the coordinating session closes tickets.
- **A gap in a shared part** (the view controls, theme switch, language picker, address state, save-as-image) is a `kazoku-ui:` ticket on the `kazoku-ui` board, not a copy or a workaround here.
- **One agent per repo**, in a new git worktree from `origin/main`. Never work in the main checkout or in another agent's worktree.
- **The must-have list.** A package is not released without its demo on Pages, an embed page, a documentation site in English and Japanese, the family files and tested usage examples (spx-stats `docs/package-work.md`, "The must-have list"; kazoku-ui `docs/package-standard.md`). `scripts/check-standard.mjs`, copied unchanged from kazoku-ui `templates/check-standard.mjs`, fails `pnpm check` when one is missing.
- **Ports.** Only the block in Facts. Check `lsof -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN` first, stop only your own process by its PID, never `pkill`.
- **Commits.** As John Morris <john@johnmorris.ca>, Conventional Commits, subject 50 characters or less, no AI attribution, files added by name (never `git add -A`). Push fast-forward to `main` after `git fetch` and a rebase.
- **Live 3D (WebGL) needs a freeze test and software drawing.** A package with WebGL has `e2e/freeze.demo.*` and `pnpm test:freeze` (one frame at a time, nothing drawn at rest or out of sight, live contexts and GPU objects flat, canvas within 6 million pixels and 4096 a side), its `release.yml` passes `freeze-command: pnpm test:freeze` to the shared release, and every Chromium project in `playwright.config` draws in software (`SOFTWARE_GL_ARGS` from `@johnmorrisdotca/kazoku-ui/testing`), never on the Mac's graphics card. One headless browser at a time, closed when finished. Details: spx-stats `docs/package-work.md`, "No 3D release without a freeze test".
- **No long pages of fold-open sections.** A stack or loop of `<details>` or accordions that a reader scrolls through to find things is not allowed in a demo or site. Put choices in clicks in a row (kind, then family, then model), tabs, a grid or a search, with the chosen thing and its options on one screen. One small "More options" fold, or one "The call that draws it" fold beside its own demo, is fine. Details: spx-stats `docs/package-work.md`, "No long pages of fold-open sections".
- **Never.** GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions or comments; a token, key or private address in any file, commit or ticket; John's SPX, SPXN or SPXIS marks in an MIT package; anything that bills; a new package name, first publish, major version, deprecation or licence change without John's yes.
- **Japanese.** Whatever you write for John, give the English beside it. A docs page is in one language.

## Checks, release, hand-off

- **Before every push** run the checks in Facts. Green locally, then green in CI after the push (`gh run watch`).
- **Release.** Make a release commit (bump `package.json`, move the CHANGELOG's Unreleased block under the version), push it, wait for CI. **Do not tag and do not publish.** John runs the Release workflow (Actions → Release → Run workflow, from `main`). It checks the tag against `package.json`, runs the repo's check script, skips a version already on npm, tags `v<version>`, and publishes by trusted publishing. The repo's `release.yml` should call kazoku-ui's `reusable-release.yml` (kazoku-ui `docs/release-workflow.md`); the trusted-publisher entry on npmjs.com names `release.yml`.
- **Hand-off** for every finished ticket: write `<ticket-id>.json` and run `SPX_HANDOFF_PROJECT=<hand-off project> python3 -I scripts/handoff/handoff.py check|write <file>` from the spx-stats checkout (the variable on the same command line; the id is the ticket's whole id). Read the replies at the start and before you finish. Then release your hold: `pnpm task --board <board> release <id> --by "<who>"`.
- **Report** in under 12 lines, first line `<your name>, ticket <id> (<title>)` (`subagent of <name>` for a subagent): what changed, shas, CI, anything John must decide, new tickets, and last `HAND-OFF WRITTEN: <path>`. If you stop for any reason, say so at once.

| Title prefix and `--area` | `taisen-brackets` |
| Ports | none: the demo tests serve `site/` to the browser through routes, with no port; a server of your own asks John for a block first |
| Checks before a push | `pnpm check`, `pnpm test:readme`, `pnpm test:usage`, `pnpm test:demo` (or the files you touched with `pnpm exec playwright test`) |

## This repo

Knockout brackets as SVG for the NHL, NBA, MLB, NFL, CFL, MLS and the World Cup, with rankings, medal tables and judo boards. Rules true only here (the long form is `CONTRIBUTING.md`):

- Zero runtime dependencies. The family's shared parts (`@johnmorrisdotca/kazoku-ui`) and Dougu Sports and Hata are dev dependencies used by the demo site only.
- Every drawing is plain SVG made from data: no DOM, no network, no script; tests compare drawings byte for byte (`test/__snapshots__`).
- Tests run with `node --test` on TypeScript source (Node 22.18 or later); there is no test runner dependency.
- Every export has a TSDoc summary, `@param`, `@returns` and an `@example` that runs: `pnpm docs:check` runs them, and `pnpm test` checks they are there.
- Shared files are copied unchanged and held to recorded hashes (`test/family.test.ts`, `test/docs-site.test.ts`, `test/standard.test.ts`): `scripts/family-template.mjs`, `scripts/family-readme.mjs`, `demo/family.css`, `scripts/docs-site.mjs`, `e2e/docs-site.demo.mjs`, `scripts/check-standard.mjs`.
- First npm publication and trusted publisher setup are John's.
